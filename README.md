# Kickstart React+Redux

## this is a basic setup for a react + redux project

-       app
        ===

        public  <!-- project's pointer -->
            |- index.html
        sass    <!-- project's stylesheets -->
            |- layout
            |- modules
            |- main.scss
        src
            |-main.js <!-- main level -->
            |- actions
            |- components
            |- containers <!-- contains app.js as top level container -->
            |- reducers

            |- config
            |- translations
            |- store

### Get started

- first you have to clone the repo
- then install the modules by running:
  `npm install`

- finally run it from app/ folder location: `npm start`

### Credits

I would like to thank Christoph Grabenstein for being with a grate help in making up this code.
